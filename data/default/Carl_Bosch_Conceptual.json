It is located within the Rhine-Ruhr metropolitan region, one of the major European metropolitan regions and the largest in Germany with more than ten million inhabitants. Cologne is located on both sides of the Rhine River, less than eighty kilometres from Belgium. The citys famous Cologne Cathedral (Kölner Dom) is the seat of the Catholic Archbishop of Cologne. The University of Cologne (Universität zu Köln) is one of Europes oldest and largest universities. Cologne was founded and established in Ubii territory in the first century AD as the Roman Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium, from which it gets its name. \"Cologne\", the French version of the citys name, has become standard in English as well. The city functioned as the capital of the Roman province of Germania Inferior and as the headquarters of the Roman military in the region until occupied by the Franks in 462. During the Middle Ages it flourished on one of the most important major trade routes between east and west in Europe. Cologne was one of the leading members of the Hanseatic League and one of the largest cities north of the Alps in medieval and Renaissance times. Up until World War II the city had undergone several occupations by the French and also by the British (1918–1926). Cologne was one of the most heavily bombed cities in Germany during World War II, the Royal Air Force (RAF) dropping 34,711 long tons of bombs on the city. The bombing reduced the population by 95%, mainly due to evacuation, and destroyed almost the entire city. With the intention of restoring as many historic buildings as possible, the successful postwar rebuilding has resulted in a very mixed and unique cityscape. Cologne is a major cultural centre for the Rhineland; it hosts more than thirty museums and hundreds of galleries. Exhibitions range from local ancient Roman archeological sites to contemporary graphics and sculpture. The Cologne Trade Fair hosts a number of trade shows such as Art Cologne, imm Cologne, Gamescom, and the Photokina.","relevanceByPageRank":"1","relevance":0.227517,"degree_outgoing":23.0,"betweenness_in":4922.4644138561125,"coefficient":0.6243386243386243,"name":"Cologne","InGlobal":1836,"topic":"Carl_Bosch","pagerank":0.17251369255233992,"relevanceBytfidf":"1"}}]},{"length":1,"rels":[{"id":"1009516","type":"relationship","label":"deathPlace","start":{"id":"213381","labels":["Carl_Bosch_Wiki_N2"]},"end":{"id":"213428","labels":["Carl_Bosch_Wiki_N2"]}}],"nodes":[{"type":"node","id":"213381","labels":["Carl_Bosch_Wiki_N2"],"properties":{"classes":["Scientist"],"communityLouvain":0,"betweenness_out":0.0,"triangles":56,"pathLenght":0,"degree_incoming":0.0,"OutGlobal":105,"BothGlobal":109,"betweenness_both":1002178.944284726,"degree_both":65.0,"tfidf_Global":0.7025351665965726,"closeness_both":0.16118126828676682,"harmonic_both_full":0.0986370278681666,"weight":0,"abstract":"Carl Bosch (27 August 1874 – 26 April 1940) was a German chemist and engineer and Nobel laureate in chemistry.

It contributes significantly to the nutritional needs of terrestrial organisms by serving as a precursor to food and fertilizers. Ammonia, either directly or indirectly, is also a building block for the synthesis of many pharmaceutical products and is used in many commercial cleaning products. Although common in nature and in wide use, ammonia is both caustic and hazardous in its concentrated form. It is classified as an extremely hazardous substance in the United States as defined in Section 302 of the U.S. Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (42 U.S.C. 11002), and is subject to strict reporting requirements by facilities which produce, store, or use it in significant quantities. The global industrial production of ammonia in 2014 was 176 million tonnes (173,000,000 long tons; 194,000,000 short tons), a 16% increase over the 2006 global industrial production of 152 million tonnes (150,000,000 long tons; 168,000,000 short tons). NH3 boils at −33.34 °C (−28.012 °F) at a pressure of one atmosphere, so the liquid must be stored under pressure or at low temperature. Household ammonia or ammonium hydroxide is a solution of NH3 in water. The concentration of such solutions is measured in units of the Baumé scale (density), with 26 degrees baumé (about 30% (by weight) ammonia at 15.5 °C or 59.9 °F) being the typical high-concentration commercial product.","relevanceByPageRank":"3","relevance":0.722519,"degree_outgoing":6.0,"betweenness_in":0.0,"coefficient":0.0,"name":"Ammonia","InGlobal":46,"topic":"Carl_Bosch","pagerank":0.15000000000000002,"relevanceBytfidf":"2"}},{"type":"node","id":"213454","labels":["Carl_Bosch_Wiki_N2"],"properties":{"classes":["Election"],"communityLouvain":0,"type":"entity","betweenness_out":2130435.649818081,"triangles":9,"pathLenght":2,"degree_incoming":13.0,"OutGlobal":57,"BothGlobal":74,"betweenness_both":36066.811637773244,"degree_both":17.0,"tfidf_Global":0.3220895435128888,"closeness_both":0.15553485831874503,"harmonic_both_full":0.09409119995636901,"weight":0,"abstract":"The Haber process, also called the Haber–Bosch process, is an artificial nitrogen fixation process and is the main industrial procedure for the production of ammonia today.

Cologne was founded and established in Ubii territory in the first century AD as the Roman Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium, from which it gets its name. \"Cologne\", the French version of the citys name, has become standard in English as well. The city functioned as the capital of the Roman province of Germania Inferior and as the headquarters of the Roman military in the region until occupied by the Franks in 462. During the Middle Ages it flourished on one of the most important major trade routes between east and west in Europe. Cologne was one of the leading members of the Hanseatic League and one of the largest cities north of the Alps in medieval and Renaissance times. Up until World War II the city had undergone several occupations by the French and also by the British (1918–1926). Cologne was one of the most heavily bombed cities in Germany during World War II, the Royal Air Force (RAF) dropping 34,711 long tons of bombs on the city. The bombing reduced the population by 95%, mainly due to evacuation, and destroyed almost the entire city. With the intention of restoring as many historic buildings as possible, the successful postwar rebuilding has resulted in a very mixed and unique cityscape. Cologne is a major cultural centre for the Rhineland; it hosts more than thirty museums and hundreds of galleries.
